We'd love if you could join us! It really should be a ton of fun!\r\n\r\nThe highlight of Aviator Pizza\u2019s menu is the hand-tossed pizza dough. Created with a 26-year old family yeast strain, once the dough is baked, the crispy sourdough crust is then brushed with the restaurant\u2019s in-house, rosemary-infused pizza oil.  \r\n\r\nThe South Congress location\u2019s menu will offer favorites from the Elgin restaurant as well as a variety of fresh menu items.  New pizza topping selections include prosciutto, arugula, freshly made mozzarella, locally made goat cheese, Texas grown heirloom tomatoes and brussel sprouts marinated in honey Sriracha sauce, to name a few. Also available on the robust menu are gluten free pizzas, garlic and cheese focaccia sticks, chicken wings, sandwiches, salads, calzones, and desserts.\r\n\r\nAviator Pizza is proud to work with local farms and producers including Fallen Oak Mushrooms, Good Flow Honey, Mozzarella Co., Elgin Heirlooms, Francis & Thatcher Farms, Vital Farms and Yegua Creek Farms, along with many others.\r\n\r\nIn addition to the food menu, Aviator Pizza\u2019s South Congress location will have an extensive rotating beer and wine list featuring 24 Texas craft beers and six wines on tap. A few of the Texas craft beers available include Big Bend, Thirsty Planet, Deep Ellum Brewing, Adelbert\u2019s Brewery, Independence Brewing, Beta Brewing and Austin Eastciders. The South Congress location will also offer growler re-fills of any brew on tap.\r\n\r\nAbout Aviator Pizza Brew Company & Aviator Pizza & Drafthouse\r\nStarted in 2014 in Elgin, TX by John McElroy and Dr. Ana Lam-McElroy, Aviator Pizza offers high quality, craft pizza, Texas craft beer and select wines.
