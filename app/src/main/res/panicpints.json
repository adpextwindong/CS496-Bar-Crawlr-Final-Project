You noticed that the street was blocked all day as we installed our brew tanks... You've noticed Sky High Brewing & Pub!\r\n\r\nThe Tasting Room is officially open on the mezzanine level; we will open the whole space in sections as each new level is ready. We plan to install as many bike racks as we can... and encourage two-wheeled transportation. :)","website":"http:\/\/www.skyhighbrewing.com","established":"2012","isOrganic":"N","status":"verified","statusDisplay":"Verified","createDate":"2013-01-25 00:07:35","updateDate":"2015-12-22 15:40:27"},"country":{"isoCode":"US","name":"UNITED STATES","displayName":"United States","isoThree":"USA","numberCode":840,"createDate":"2012-01-03 02:41:33"}},{"id":"W2dlxg","name":"McMenamins on Monroe Brewery","streetAddress":"2001 N.W.

In 2011 our breweries collectively crafted 3302 batches of beer (including over 250 new and unusual house-specific recipes) more than 47,263 kegs of beer or an astounding 5.8 million pints!\r\n\r\nIn keeping with McMenamins' company philosophy, our breweries believe that brewing \"green\" is brewing responsibly.\r\n\r\nMany beer lovers are familiar with our ales, such as Terminator Stout, Hammerhead, Ruby, Edgefield Wheat, Black Rabbit Porter, Sunflower IPA and others. Read more about these \"standards\" and dozens of others, including our beloved seasonal ales.\r\n\r\nDue to the nature of handcrafting, it's safe to say that no two McMenamins batches are identical. Science and technology provide the backbone for our craft, but it is the unique qualities of each brew house, and the individual brewer's ale-crafting style, that ensure you will enjoy liquid refreshments that are truly special and made with every care for the environment.
